## 3. Detailed Description

### The Art of Logical Calm
Welcome to the debut experience from **Logic and Chill**. Aura Logic isn’t just a puzzle game; it’s a sanctuary for the intellectually curious. We’ve stripped away the noise to leave you with what matters: elegant challenges, premium design, and the satisfying click of a solved mystery.

### Deterministic by Design
Every level in Aura Logic is hand-crafted and 100% solvable through pure deduction. There is no guessing, no "maybe," and no luck involved. When you find the solution, you’ll know exactly why it works. It’s the ultimate confidence in logic.

### Tactile Zen
Feel the logic. We’ve integrated high-fidelity haptics and a minimalist aesthetic to ensure every interaction feels intentional. The interface stays out of your way, allowing the "Tactile Zen" of the puzzles to take center stage. It’s premium relaxation for your mind and your fingertips.

### Master the 'Two-Not-Touch'
At the heart of Aura Logic is a deceptively simple rule: **Two-Not-Touch**. 
1. Place exactly two stars in every row, column, and colored region.
2. The catch? Stars can never touch each other—not even diagonally.
It’s a dance of constraints that starts simple and evolves into a profound test of spatial reasoning.

### Offline-First Philosophy
Your focus shouldn’t depend on a signal. Aura Logic is built to be **Offline-First**. Whether you’re on a long flight, a remote retreat, or simply silencing the digital world, your puzzles are always ready. No ads, no interruptions, just you and the logic.
