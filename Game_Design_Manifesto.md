## 1. Puzzle Game Design Manifesto (2026 Trends)

In 2026, the iOS puzzle market has shifted away from aggressive monetization and toward **"Micro-Flow"** states—short, high-quality bursts of cognitive satisfaction.

*   **Tactile Satisfaction:** Every interaction must feel physical. Haptic feedback and spatial audio are no longer optional; they are the "juice" that keeps players engaged.
*   **The 'Anti-Anxiety' Loop:** Puzzles should provide a sense of order in a chaotic world. No timers, no "fail" screens—only "evolutions" of the puzzle state.
*   **AIGC Personalization:** Use lightweight on-device AI to subtly adjust puzzle difficulty and color palettes based on the user's play style and time of day.
*   **Zero-Loading UX:** Games must launch and be playable in under 3 seconds. The "Resume" state is the primary menu.

## 2. MVP Concept Proposals

### Concept A: "Onyx Fold"
*   **Core Mechanic (The Hook):** A digital "origami" logic puzzle. Players swipe to fold a single 2D shape into a target 3D silhouette. The hook is the **"Snap-to-Shape"** haptic feedback when a fold is correct.
*   **Visual Style:** Minimalist (Ink-on-Paper). High contrast, sharp lines, and fluid animations.
*   **Monetization Strategy:** **Premium Unlock.** First 20 levels are free; a single $2.99 IAP unlocks the remaining 200 levels and a "Zen Mode."

### Concept B: "Lume Link"
*   **Core Mechanic (The Hook):** "Refractive Routing." Players rotate glass prisms on a grid to bounce a light beam into a receiver. The hook is the **Chromatic Aberration** effect—mixing colors (Red + Blue = Purple) to hit specific colored targets.
*   **Visual Style:** High-Tech / Neon. Glow effects, dark backgrounds, and synth-wave ambient audio.
*   **Monetization Strategy:** **Incentivized Ads.** Non-intrusive "Hint" ads. Players can watch a 5-second video to reveal the next prism placement.

### Concept C: "Moss & Mend"
*   **Core Mechanic (The Hook):** "Pattern Stitching." Players are given a "broken" stone path and must drag fragments of mossy stones to complete a continuous circuit. The hook is the **Growth Animation**—once the circuit is complete, flowers bloom along the path.
*   **Visual Style:** Cozy / Ghibli-inspired. Soft textures, watercolor palettes, and nature sounds (birds, wind).
*   **Monetization Strategy:** **Subscription (Apple Arcade Style) or Cosmetic IAP.** Free to play with seasonal "Garden Themes" (Autumn, Winter) available for $0.99 each.

## 3. iOS UX Standards (Touch Interface 2026)

*   **The "Thumb Zone" Optimization:** All primary interactions (swipes, taps) must occur in the bottom 40% of the screen to accommodate larger Pro Max devices.
*   **Multi-Modal Feedback:** 
    *   *Haptic:* Sharp "taps" for errors, soft "pulses" for progress.
    *   *Visual:* Contextual highlighting—elements slightly enlarge when the finger is hovering near them.
*   **Gesture-First Navigation:** Eliminate "Back" buttons. Use edge-swipes and pinch-to-zoom for all menu transitions.
*   **Dynamic Island Integration:** Use the Dynamic Island to show puzzle progress or "Next Piece" previews while the user is multitasking.
